<Mikael Mohlin - Week 13>

30/3
The first meeting of our group (6) was held. Everyone decided on what parts they wanted to work on. Which means that i will be working
on the mobile application for this project. And if needed, I will also help in the backend side of this project.
For app development we choose to work with Android.

31/3
Today we had our first meeting with only the frontend group. We started talking about the different requirements of the mobile applications and how
we could achive them. We also decided that the meetings should be held remote via Discord for rest of the project, since the members of this group live
quite far away from eachother.

Total hours spent: ~ 8hours
