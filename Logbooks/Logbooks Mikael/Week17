<Mikael Mohlin - Week 17>

25/4
A sprint planning meeeting was held with the whole group. Our goal from the frontend was to initiate a connection from the app to the mover.
~ 1 hour

26/4
Took some time to watch some of the pre-recorded lectures, since I had not watched them yet.
~ 4 hours

28/4
Spent the day working at the school with intention to finalize the bluetooth connection bewteen the app and mover. And eventually after a couple of hours,
we finally managed to make the connection work. 
So, inside the app there is a connection button within the ConnectFragment. When the user taps on that button, the app will try to look for and connect to
a device with a pre-defined MAC-Address and UUId, which in our case is the mover.
~ 6 hours

29/4
A retrospective meeting was held with the whole group. We, from the frontend had good news about bluetooth, where we finally have fixed the blutooth-
connect feature. From that point forward, our next task was to figure out how to send data over the bluetooth connection and fortunately, two people 
from our group offered to work on it over the weekend.
I took some time after the meeting to merge my branch (where I worked on the bluetooth connection) and merge it with the main branch.
~ 4 hours

Total time spent: ~ 15 hours
