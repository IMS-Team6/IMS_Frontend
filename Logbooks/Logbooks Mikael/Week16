<Mikael Mohlin - Week 16>

20/4
A meeting with the whole group was held with intention to get an update on how everyone was doing on the project.
The hardware team was done with setting up the bluetooth connection from their own part and simply waited for us in the frontend to finalize our
bluetooth functioanlity from the app. The backend was still working with their API and had as a goal to finalize it at the end of this week.
We from the frontend team was still not done with bluetooth, since we had some problems with permissions and connections on the app.
Another member of the frontend group had worked on bluetooth for a while now, but did encounter these mentioned problems, so I decided to create a new branch
with intention to try implementing bluetooth. At the end of the day, I did manage to implement so that user-permissions and scanning of bluetooth devices worked
on the app. But it was still much to do left.
(~ 6 hours)

21/4
I continued working with bluetooth on my own branch, where I worked on trying to setup a bluetooth connection with another device. The external device
I tested a connection with was my laptop, and after a few hours of grinding I finally managed to connect the application with the laptop. However, I noticed
that once i wanted to connect a second time it wouldnt work, so I still had some problems yet to fix.
(~ 8 hours)

Total hours spend: ~ 16 hours
