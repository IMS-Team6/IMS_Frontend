2/5 
A sprint meeting was held with the entire group. We are done with the bluetooth connection and we can now send data. 
Our goal for this weekend was to send data to the mower (drive forward,backward,right and left…)

3/5
We in front end group had a meeting where we talked about how long we have done and what we are going to do next. 

2H

I worked with the datastream. I Implemented a socket where we could send data to the mower via bluetooth. 
I had more communication with the DIS group than usual because of the datastream. In the beginning they wanted to receive the 
data as a string but later they changed it to INT so I had to change my code also. Some buttons were created in the Control fragment
where each button sends a specific integer that the DIS is going to handle. The socket I implemented sends data in a byte array.

Hours: 5

4/5
Since i live far away from Jönköping i couldn't rally see the results of my implementation on the raspberry pie so i decided to
get my own pie and test the data steam. I asked the DIS group to send me the Python code so i could run it and test the application.
After the pie setup it become easier to handle the errors and see how the Pie was receiving the data.

Hours: 4
