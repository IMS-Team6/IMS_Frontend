This week we had a lot of meething with the sub group and the hole group. The project is about go get done and we needed to make sure that everything
is correctly done and that the doc is done for the hole project.

one of the meetings that we had was about whriting "lesson learnd" we didnt know really how to begin with it but one of us created a document and evreyone in the 
group was allowd to join and begin to type in the document. 
After every point of typing we had a little disskution.
