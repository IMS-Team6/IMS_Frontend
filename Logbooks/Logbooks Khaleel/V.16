A meeting with the full group was held in discord with motive to get an update on how all groups were doing on the project.
Dis group (Hardware) finished the bluetooth setup and the connection and was waiting for me to get done with the BLE connection. 
The Back end has some problems with the API and has not solved their problems yet.
I explained for the group what problems I had with the permissions and why it was hard to solve those problems.
After the meeting I worked with bluetooth. 
Hours: 6 hours

21/4
Till now I have created 3 seperate projects about bluetooth for testing if the problem is in our project settings or in my code.
At the end of day i managed to solve the permission problem and after that it was easier to continue, i created a view where all available 
bluetooth devices showed up. A button was also Created to connect to a specific UUID address (mower address was the target) but since i wasn't able to
go to the school and test my code on the mower/Raspberry Pi i had to find a device that was supporting BLE connection to test my code on. I contacted 
the DIS group and told them that the code was done and if they could test it one the  Raspberry Pi so that I know if the code works as it should. 
The logic in the code was right and it should work but we haven't tested it yet.
Hours: 8-9 hours
