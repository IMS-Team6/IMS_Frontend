The group meeting went well today and we had long conversations about the goals we had. All three mini groups presented their sub-goals, 
we in the front-end had a sub goal to set up and establish connection with the mower.
The backend worked with the setting up of the API. And Hardware worked with bluetooth functionality on the mower.
The rest of the day I spend time exploring more in kotlin and implementing basic code and running the simulator to see it live as an application. 
Hours: 4 hours

I had a meeting with a front-end group where we talked about user story from the project in detail. And each member in the group was assigned one of the user storyto work on. 
I finished creating foar fragments (Connect, Control, Map,Image) where every one in the group will be able to work on separate fragment without mixing code with others.

Hours: 4 hours

With the group we had decided that I will take the bluetooth fragment to work on. I had contact with the hardware regarding what bluetooth data they want to
receive and which bluetooth. They worked with BLE bluetooth so bothe my research and code was based on that. It was hard to find documentation about BLE and it
took a long time to get started with that. A Lot of errors was hard to solve.
Hours: 5 hours 


14/4
 I followed some tutorials and implemented the code but the errors was to many and a big reason for that was that the code was in JAVA and i used kotlin and even
 when i translated it to kotlin some errors was left because of newer version of kotlin.
