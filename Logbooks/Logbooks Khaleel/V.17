I found out that the DIS group had changed from BLE connection to classic connection which made it completely different in my case,
I had to start over and completely a different code and spend more time on that so we could present a complete code for next week.

In this weekend a spend a lot of time one the classic bluetooth connection. I drove to jönköping and stayed there for to days so i can complete the bluetooth part.
I took the raspberry pie from DIS because i wanted to make sure that everything was working correct. Me and Kero (DIS student) worked together. 
He was setting up an environment on the raspberry pie so that i could test my code. I managed to get a connection and could send data to the pie with an byte array.
I tested the code multiple times and every thing was working right. 

Hours : 10
