Meeting with whole group. Each member of the group got to choose in which part they wanted to work in. 
I choose frontend. In frontend we had two options swift programming in XCode for IOS apps or Kotlin programming 
language in Android Studio for Android apps. We choose Android studio. The GitHub project created for determining 
user stories from EPICS. Everyone in the group decided on which part is working including leader of the group. 
Also, the frontend group decided to have our own meeting for tomorrow ¼ at 2pm.
