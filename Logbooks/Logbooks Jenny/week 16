Meeting with whole group. Update of what have been done so far. Hardware are done with Bluetooth connection and the set-up from frontend is awaited. We didnâ€™t manage to make connection yet because every time we update the session connection get disconnected. 
Sprint planning is that API from backend need to be completed and frontend need to make sure that Bluetooth connecting is ready.
